# Space Invaders
I developed a space fighting game where the objective is to protect a space station from alien invaders. 
Commanding a battleship, the goal is for you to take down as many targets as you can until itâ€™s too late.
The game is also divided into three modes based on the nature of difficulty subject to each player: easy, normal, and hard. 
The space station can take at most three hits before it is beyond repair and it's game over.
